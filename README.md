# Hello Software

## Description

This is a MERN-stack ecommerce web app.  The goal of this app is to fill a need for one-on-one targeted coaching and skill development in computer programming.  The design follows a Single Page App (SPA) approach.  There are three primary sections of the SPA layout:  header, main, and footer.  The header and footer remain mostly static throughout a user's interaction with the site.  The main page changes and is routed dependent on a user's navigation.
